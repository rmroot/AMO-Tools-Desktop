                            For each pump type there is an optimal specific speed based on size, flow rate, specific speed. Hydraulic Institute standards
                            also include factors for wear and surface finish on wetted parts but these two factors are not
                            considered in the PSAT calculations. Operation at the optimal specific speed allows a pump to
                            operate at maximum efficiency. This calculator determines the specific speed for a pump at the
                            given conditions and calculates the amount of efficiency penalty to be deducted from the maximum
                            value due to operation away from the optimal specific speed.

                          The Combine Heat and Power (CHP) calculator is intended to help plant managers and other intended
                          parties to conduct a very preliminary initial screening of the potential CHP cost savings at
                          the facility based on - Annual Electricity Consumption, Annual Thermal Loads, Average Electricity
                          and Fuel prices and Annual Operating hours. This calculator is not intended to estimate the economic
                          performance of a specific CHP project, rather it is intended to only give the user an initial understanding
                          of whether CHP has the potential to provide economic savings at their facility.
